# Analyzing-website-traffic-data_202401100400185
This project focuses on analyzing website traffic data to gain valuable insights into user behavior and website performance.
By examining key metrics such as page views, session duration, bounce rates, and traffic sources, 
we aim to understand how visitors interact with the site. The analysis helps identify patterns, trends, and potential areas for improvement,
which can inform decisions to optimize user experience, enhance site content, and improve marketing strategies.
Ultimately, this analysis supports data-driven decision-making to drive growth and increase engagement on the website.
